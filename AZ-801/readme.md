### üìö deploy and manage domain controllers in Azure
> Note: The VMs that are DCs should have a seperate data disk for storing the database, logs, and sysvol folder for Active Directory. Do not store these items on the same disk as the operating system. By default data disks that are attached to a VM use write-through caching. However this form of caching can conflict with the requirements of AD DS. For this reason, set the *Host Cache Preference* setting on the data disk to *None*.

Deploy at least two VMs as DCs and add them to an availability set.

The DCs in Azure should be part of a seperate AD DS site. Make a site link from the Azure site, to your on-premises AD DS sites, and AD DS will automatically perform the most efficient database replication possible.

It's not recommended to deploy FSMO roles on the DCs in Azure

Azure VMs that are operating as DCs should be shutdown from inside the guest OS and not through the Azure portal.

### üìö deploy Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs)

### ‚úÖ troubleshoot flexible single master operations (FSMO) roles
**Multi-master model** A multi-master enabled database, like AD, provides the flexibility of allowing changes to occur at any DC in the enterprise. But it also introduces the possibility of conflicts that can potentially lead to problems once the data is replicated. For certain types of changes, Windows incorporates methods to prevent conflicting Active Directory updates from occurring.

**Single-master model** To prevent conflicting updates in Windows, the Active Directory performs updates to certain objects in a single-master fashion. In a single-master model, only one DC in the entire directory is allowed to process updates. Active Directory extends the single-master model found in earlier versions of Windows to include multiple rols, and the ability to transfer roles to any DC in the enterprise. Because an AD role isn't bound to a single DC, it's referred to as an FSMO role.

FSMO roles:
- Schema master
- Domain naming master
- RID master
- PDC emulator
- Infrastructure master

üìú**Schema master FSMO role** 
`only one schema master per forest`
The schema master is the DC responsible for performing updates to the directory schema, that is, the *schema* naming context or `LDAP://cn=schema,cn=configuration,dc=<domain>`. This DC is the only one that can process updates to the directory schema. Once the schema update is complete, it's replicated from the schema master to all other DCs in the directory.

üìú**Domain naming master FSMO role**
`only one domain naming master per forest`
The domain naming master is the DC responsible for making changes to the forest-wide domain name space of the directory, that is, the *Partitions\Configuration* naming context or `LDAP://CN=Partitions,CN=Configuration,DC=<domain>`. This DC is the only one that can add or remove a domain from the directory. It can also add or remove cross references to domains in external directories.
  
üìú**RID master FSMO role**
`only one rid master per domain`
The rid master is the single DC responsible from processing RID Pool requests from all DCs within the domain. It's also responsible for removing an object from its domain and putting it in another domain during an object move. <br />
When a DC creates a security principal object, like a user or group, it attaches a unique Security ID (SID) to the object. This SID consists of:
- a domain SID that's the same for all SIDs created in a domain
- a relative ID (RID) that's unique for each security Principal SID created in a domain <br />
Each DC in a domain is allocated a pool of RIDs that it can use on new security principals it creates. WHen the DC's RID Pool falls below a threshold, it requests more from the RID master
  
üìú**PDC emulator FSMO role**
`only one pdc emulator per domain`
the pdc emulator is necessary to synchronize time in an enterprise. Windows includes the W32Time (Windows Time) service that is required by Kerberos. All Windows-based computers within an enterprise use a common time, to ensure the use of a hierarchical relationship that controls authority. <br />
The pdc emulator of a domain is authoritave for the domain. The PDC emulator at the root of the forest becomes authoritative for the enterprise, and shuld be configured to gather the time from an external source. <br />
The pdc emulator role holder retains the following functions:
- Password changes done by other DCs are replicated preferentially to the pdc emulator
- When authentication failures occur on a DC because of an incorrect password, the failures are forwared to the pdc emulator before a bad password failure message is given to the user
- Account lockout is processed on the pdc emulator
- The pdc emulator performs all the functions that a Windows NT4.0 server-based pdc would perform
  
üìú**Infrasturcture master FSMO role**
`only one infrasturcture master per domain`
The infrastructure master is the DC responsible for updating an object's SID and distinguished name (DN) in a cross-domain object reference. When an object in one domain is referenced by another object in another domain, it represents the reference by : the GUID, the SID (references to security principals), and the DN on the object being referenced.
> Note: The Infrastructure Master role should be held by a DC that's not a Glocal Gatalog (GC). Unless all DCs are GCs then it isn't important which DC holds the role

> Note: When the Recycle Bin optional feature is enabled, every DC is responsible to update its cross-domain object references. in which case there are no tasks associated with the Inrastructure Master and it isn't important which DC holds the role

To view what DCs hold what roles, go to Active Directory Users and Computers (*dsa.msc*), right-click on the domain object and select **Operations Masters** <br />

For the schema master add the Active Directory Schema snap-in to mmc, then right-click on "Active Directory Schema" and select Operations Masters

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274282/152247091-8870f54a-e6a0-4d47-bbe3-144810e774c7.png)

> Note: for the Active Directory Schema snap-in to be avalible, you may have to run `regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll` which should output something like "DllRegisterServer in schmmgmt.dll succeeded."

For the domain naming role, go to Active Directory Domains and Trusts and right-click Active Directory Domains and Trusts and select Operationas Manster.

You can also run this to get the role holders in a domain
```
DCdiag /test:KNowsofroleholders /v
```

To transfer FSMO roles
```powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity "dc02" -OperationMasterRole InfrastructureMaster
```

### üìö implement group managed service accounts (gMSAs)

There are two types of Managed Service Account, standalone Manged Service Account (sMSA) and group Managed Service Acount (gMSA)

> Note: The schema in the domain you are using gMSAs must be at a Server 2012 functional level

Microsoft Key Distribution Service (kdssvc.dll). There needs to be a master root key for Active Directory. To see if there is a key already, use
```powershell
Get-KdsRootKey
```
To make a new key
```powershell
Add-KdsRootKey -EffectiveImmediately
```

Failover clusters don't support gMSAs

AES should always be used for MSAs

> Note: The password change interval can only be set during creation. To change you must create a new gMSA.

## Manage Hyper-V and guest virtual machines
### ‚úÖ enable VM enhanced session mode
> **Virtual Machine Connection (VMConnect)** lets you use a computer's local resources in a virtual machine, like removable USB flash drive or a printer. Enhanced session mode also lets you resize the VMConnect window.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274282/152070460-c501629c-a57a-4af4-84cd-04eaee0cd1d3.png)

When Applied there is a button to switch to enhanced session mode at the top of VMConnect

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274282/152070762-82c19eb1-8984-4cfa-ac98-e881e9d7c751.png)

If you need to edit your connection settings you can run 

```powershell
VMConnect.exe <ServerName> <VMName> /edit
```
Requirements for using local resources
- The Hyper-V host must have **Enhanced session mode policy** and **Enhanced session mode** settings turned on.
- The computer on which you use VMConnect must run Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2.
- The virtual machine must have Remote Desktop Services enabled, and run Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2012 R2 as the guest operating system. 

Other Benifits
> **Prevent a VMConnect user from taking over another user's VMConnect session** - Not having enhanced session mode turned on may pose a security and privacy risk. If a user is connected and logged on to a virtual machine through VMConnect and another authorized user connects to the same virtual machine, the session will be taken over by the second user and the first user will lose the session. The second user will be able to view the first user's desktop, documents, and applications.

### ‚úÖ manage VM using PowerShell Remoting, PowerShell Direct, and HVC.exe

Powershell Direct works on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and above (OS requirment for the host and guest). PowerShell Direct allows Windows Powershell management inside a VM regardless of the network configuration or remote management settings on the host or guest VM.

You can either use **PSSession** or **Invoke-Command** to use it, no configuration required.

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -VMName "Win01"
```
or
```powershell
Invoke-Command -VMName "Win01" -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
```

### ‚úÖ configure nested virtualization
> Note: Nested Virtualization is supported in both Azure and on-premises. However, the nested virtual machines are not supported for production purposes. Labs, testing environments, demo environments, etc, are more of it's purpose.

**Intel CPUs with VT-x and EPT**
- (Host) Windows Server 2016 / Windows 10 or greater

**AMD EPYC/Ryzen CPUs**
- (Host) Windows Server 2022 / Windows 11 or greater

While the VM is off run 
```powershell
Set-VMProcessor -VMName "Win01" -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
```
> Note: When Hyper-V is running inside a VM, the VM must be turned off to adjust it's memory. Meaning that even if dynamic memory is enabled, the ammount of memory will not fluctuate. Any attempt to adjust the ammount of memory while it's on will fail.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274282/152213325-8750e004-9f48-43b6-9be9-f7277b811dc2.png)

**Networking**
- **Mac Address Spoofing** In order for packets to be routed throu two virtual switches, MAC address spoofing must be enabled on the first (L1) level of virtual switch. You can do it with 
```powershell
Set-VMNetworkAdapter -VMName "Win01" -MacAddressSpoofing On
```

- **Network Address Translation (NAT)** This is best suited for cases where MAC address spoofing is not possible, like in a public cloud environment. First a virtual NAT switch must be created in the host VM (the "middle" VM) 
```powershell
New-VMSwitch -Name VmNAT -SwitchType Internal
New-NetNat -Name LocalNAT -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix "192.168.100.0/24"
# Then assign an IP to the net adapter
Get-NetAdapter "vEthernet (VmNat)" | New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 192.168.100.1 -AddressFamily IPv4 -PrefixLength 24
# Then in each nested VM assign an IP address on that network
```

> Note: In my personal experience I did not have to do either and the networking just worked „Ñü( ‚ñî, ‚ñî )„Ñè

### ‚úÖ configure VM memory

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274282/151913437-dfee810b-7999-416a-9d5c-c2e9e412ce3b.png)

Powershell:
```powershell
Get-VMMemory | fl -Property *
```
```powershell
Set-VMMemory -VMName <client01> -Buffer 20 -Priority 37 -MaximumBytes 5GB
```
You can also adjust the settings with, but it doesn't have the buffer or priority
```powershell
Get-VM -Name <client01> | Set-VM -MemoryMinimum 2GB
```

> **Dynamic Memory** - If you have idle or low-load virtual machines, as in pooled Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments, Dynamic Memory enables you to increase consolidation and improve reliability for restart operations. You also gain agility in responding to requirement changes with these new capabilities.

Hyper-V enables users to make the following configuration changes to Dynamic Memory when the virtual machine is running:
- Increase the maximum memory.
- Decrease the minimum memory.

> **Smart Paging** - Although minimum memory increases virtual machine consolidation numbers, it also brings a challenge. If a virtual machine has a smaller amount of memory than its startup memory and if it is restarted, Hyper-V needs additional memory to restart the virtual machine. Due to host memory pressure or virtual machine states, Hyper-V may not always have additional memory available. This can cause sporadic virtual machine restart failures. Smart Paging is used to bridge the memory gap between minimum memory and startup memory, and allow virtual machines to restart reliably.

To minimize the performance impact of Smart Paging, Hyper-V uses it only when all of the following occurs:
- The virtual machine is being restarted.
- There is no available physical memory.
- No memory can be reclaimed from other virtual machines running on the host.

Smart Paging is not used when:
- A virtual machine is being started from an ‚Äúoff state‚Äù (instead of a restart).
- Oversubscribing memory for a running virtual machine is required.
- A virtual machine is failing over in Hyper-V clusters.

Also note the following about how Smart Paging is used:
- Smart Paging files are created only when needed for a virtual machine.
- After the additional amount of memory is removed, Smart Paging files are deleted.
- Smart Paging is not used for this virtual machine again until another restart occurs and there is not enough physical memory.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Startup RAM	| Specifies the amount of memory required to start the virtual machine. The value needs to be high enough to allow the guest operating system to start, but should be as low as possible to allow for optimal memory utilization and potentially higher consolidation ratios. |
| Minimum RAM	| Specifies the minimum amount of memory that should be allocated to the virtual machine after the virtual machine has started. The value can be set as low as 32 MB to a maximum value equal tothe Startup RAM Value | 
| Maximum RAM |	Specifies the maximum amount of memory that this virtual machine is allowed to use. The value can be set from as low as the value for Startup RAM to as high as 1 TB. However, a virtual machine can use only as much memory as the maximum amount supported by the guest operating system. For example, if you specify 64 GB for a virtual machine running a guest operating system that supports a maximum of 32 GB, the virtual machine cannot use more than 32 GB. |
| Memory buffer |	Specifies how much memory Hyper-V will attempt to assign to the virtual machine compared to the amount of memory actually needed by the applications and services running inside the virtual machine. Memory buffer is specified as a percentage because the actual amount of memory that represents the buffer changes in response to changes in memory usage while the virtual machine is running. Hyper-V uses performance counters in the virtual machine that identify committed memory to determine the current memory requirements of the virtual machine and then calculates the amount of memory to add as a buffer. The buffer is determined using the following formula: <br /> <br /> Amount of memory buffer = how much memory the virtual machine actually needs / (memory buffer value / 100). <br /> <br /> For example, if the memory committed to the guest operating system is 1000 MB and the memory buffer is 20%, Hyper-V will attempt to allocate an additional 20% (200 MB) for a total of 1200 MB of physical memory allocated to the virtual machine. Note: The buffer is not maintained when there is not enough physical memory available in the computer to give every virtual machine its requested memory buffer. |
| Memory weight |	Provides Hyper-V with a way to determine how to distribute memory among virtual machines if there is not enough physical memory available in the computer to give every virtual machine its requested amount of memory. |

The current amount of memory available to virtual machines can be viewed in the following Performance Monitor counter, **Hyper-V Dynamic Memory Balancer ‚Äì Available Memory**.

### ‚úÖ configure Integrated Services
Integration services (also called integration components), are services that allow the virtual machine to communicate with the Hyper-V host. Many of these services are conveniences while others can be quite important to the VM's ability to function

They can be turned on and off in Hyper-V Manager or in PowerShell

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51274282/152277044-cf4d4e90-f8ae-413e-a35e-1fe785c413c8.png)

```powershell
Get-VMIntegrationService -VMName "Win01"
```
```powershell
Enable-VMIntegrationService -VMName "Win01" -Name "Guest Service Interface"
# You can also use Disable-VMIntegrationService to disable it
```
They are also managable from the guest, although it's best to do it from the host

| Powershell Name | Windows Service Name | Description | Impact if disabled |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Guest Service Interface | vmicguestinterface | Provides an interface for the Hyper-V to copy files from the VM | Low |
| Heartbeat | vmicheartbeat  | Reports that the virtual machine is running correctly | Varies |
| Key-Value Pair Exchange | vmickvpexchange | Provides a way to exchange basic metadata between the VM and host | Varies |
| Shutdown | vmicshutdown | Allows the host to trigger VMs shutdown | High |
| Time Synchronization | vmictimesync | Synchronizes the VM's clock with the host's clock | High |
| VSS | vmicvss | Allows Volume Shadow Copy to back up the VM without shutting it down | Varies |
|  | vmiccmsession | Provides a way to manage VMs with PowerShell without a network connection | Low |

### ‚úÖ configure hypervisor scheduling types
There are different virtual processor scheduling modes that determine how the hypervisor allocaates and manages work across guest virtual processors. You can select hypervisor scheduler types that are best suited for the guest VMs and configure the VMs to take advantage of the scheduling logic 

> Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) - A technique utilized in modern processor designs that allow the processor's resources to be shared by seperate, independent execution threads. The individual technologies are Intel HyperThreading and AMD SMT

Core Hyper-V concepts to understand
- Hyper-V creates and manages **VM partitions**, across which compute resources are allowcated and shared, under control of the hypervisor. **Partitions** provide strong isolation boundaries between all guest VMs, and between guest VMs and the root partition.
- The root partition is itself a VM partition, although it has unique properties and much greater privileges than guest VMs. The root partition provides the management services that control all guest VMs, provides virtual device support for guests, and manages all device I/O for guest VMs. Microsoft strongly recommends not runnig any application workloads in the root partition.
- Each virtual processor (VP) of the root partition is mapped 1:1 to an underlying logical processor (LP). A host VP always runs on the same underlying LP - there is no migration of the root partition's VPs.
- By default, the LPs on which host VPs run can also run guest VPs.
- A guest VP may be scheduled by the hypervisor to run on any available logical processor. While the hypervisor scheduler takes care to consider temporal cache locality, NUMA topology, and many other factors when scheduling a guest VP, ultimately the VP could be scheduled on any host LP.

**Hypervisor scheduler types**

üïì The **Classic Scheduler** <br />
The classic scheduler provides a fair share, preemptive round-robin scheduling model for guest VPs.

Classic is the default on Windows Server 2016 and earlier

üïó The **Core Scheduler**
The core scheduler offers a strong security boundary for guest workload isolation, and reduced performance variability for workloads inside of VMs that are running on an SMT-enabled virtualization host. The scheduler can iptionally expose SMT pairs to guest VMs. <br />
The overall result of the core scheduler is that:
- Guest VPs are contrained to run on underlying physicalcore pairs, isolating a VM to processor core boundaries, thus reducing vulnerability to side-channel snooping attacks from malicious VMs.
- Variability in throughput is significantly reduced.
- Performance is potentially reduced, because if only one of a group of VPs can run, only one of the instruction streams in the core executes while the other is left idle.
- The OS and appllications running in the guest VM can utilize SMT

Core is the defualt Windows Server 2019 on onward

üï• The **Root Scheduler**

The root scheduler lets the hypervisor cede control of work scheduling to the root partition . The NT scheduler in theroot partition's OS instance manages all aspects of scheduling work to system LPs. It enables things like Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) on the host OS.

Root is default on Windows 10 version 1803 on onward (should not be used in Windows Server)

üöß**Managing the Scheduler**üöß

To set it on the guest VM use
```powershell
Set-VMProcessor -VMName "Win01" -HwThreadCountPerCore 0
```
> Note: Setting -HwThreadCountPerCore = 0 means it will use what the host is set to, you can also use 1 or 2 

To set it on the hostuse 
```
bcdedit /set hypervisorschedulertype Core
```
You can use Classic, Core, or Root

To see what the current scheduler is, there is an event log with the Event ID=2 that show the type.
- 0x1 - Classic Scheduler, SMT disabled
- 0x2 - Classic Scheduler
- 0x3 - Core Scheduler
- 0x4 - Root Scheduler

- **Production Checkpoints** which are "point in time"
- **Standard Checkpoints** which captures the state, data, and hardware configureation

### ‚úÖ resize Azure Virtual Machines
After you create a virtual machine (VM), you can scale the VM up or down by changing the VM size.
> Note: In some cases, you must deallocate the VM first. This can happen if the new size is not avalable on the hardware cluster that is currently hosting the VM.

> Note: if the VM uses Premium Storage, make sure that you choose an **s** version of the size to get Premium Storage support
